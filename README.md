# Final Project: Vaccination Coverage for One-Year-Olds Around the World

This project will be displaying and comparing the data of vaccination coverage for one - year olds around the world. I will be using vaccination coverage data from [*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination). The specific CVS dataset used is from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-worlds-number-of-vaccinated-one-year-olds?time=1980..latest and https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination. The datasets used are the vaccination coverage by income and the number of one-year-olds who received different vaccinations. 

### Hypothesis:
A country's GDP per capita is a great determinative of if a country is industrial and developed. A high or low, the GDP per capita, we can infer the size of the country's economy. Using the GDP per capita of countries and the vaccination coverage for one - year olds around the world datasets, we can observe that  a country is more likely to have higher percentages of one years olds that are vaccinated due to their high GDP per capita compare to country with lower GDP.
