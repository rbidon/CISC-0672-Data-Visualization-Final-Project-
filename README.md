# Final Project: Vaccination Coverage for One-Year-Olds Around the World

This project will be displaying and comparing the data of vaccination coverage for one - year olds around the world. I will be using vaccination coverage data from [*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination). The specific CVS dataset used is from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-worlds-number-of-vaccinated-one-year-olds?time=1980..latest and https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination. The datasets used are the vaccination coverage by income and the number of one-year-olds who received different vaccinations.
